# PhD Project Data Prep

The goal of this project is was to investigate changes in MRI-based biological markers in individuals who carry the genetic mutation for frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

The data used in this project is from the The Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI) and consists of longitudinal MRI scans as well as demographisc and  clinical information (diagnosis, results of cognitive, behavioural, neuropsychological, and functional assessments). Participants include those who have been diagnosed with FTD, caused by a genetic mutation, individuals who carry the genetic mutation but have not yet developed symptoms, and individuals who do not carry the mutation.

You can find more information on GENFI [here](https://www.genfi.org/).

Here you will find code used to clean and organize the data in preparation for analysis.
